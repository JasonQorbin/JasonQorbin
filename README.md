# 👋 Hi, I’m Jason

I'm a (mostly) self-taught programmer that doing formal training in full stack development. 
Most of my practical experience in real world projects has been in creating business tools
both small and large, primarily using VBA scripts but also sometimes Java and Python when I
needed to throw something simple together super-quick.

- 🌱 I’m currently transitioning from my current job in corporate finance (where I also
  serve as a part-time defacto developer writing and maintaining internal tools for the
  company) to a more formal role in the software development space with the aim of becoming
  a full-stack developer.

# Projects I'm working on 🚧️🏗️

- A web-app based personal finance app. Because I've never been qute happy with any of the
existing apps I've tried.
