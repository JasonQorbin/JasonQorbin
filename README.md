👋 Hi, I’m @JasonQorbin

I'm a (mostly) self-taught programmer that dabbles with many technologies but most of my practical experience in real world projects has been in creating business tools both small and large, primarily using VBA scripts but also sometimes Java when I needed to throw something simple together super-quick (I've only recently discovered the wonders of Python and Node.js so please don't throw shade, I know better now).

- 🌱 I’m currently transitioning from my current job in corporate finance (where I also serve as a part-time defacto developer writing and maintaining internal tools for the company) to a more formal role in the software development space with the aim of becoming a full-stack developer.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something or other. Not sure what yet. One of my favourite languages is C++ but I never found something that actually required me using it that I couldn't accomlish easier and faster with less vebose language.
